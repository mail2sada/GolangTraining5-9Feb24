# Variable
A variable is a placeholder of the information which can change at runtime. And variables allow to Retrieve and Manipulate the stored information. A variable can store data of datatype. Variable that can hold int is referred as integer variable, variable that can hold a string is called string variable, etc.

## Variable declaration
Variables are declared using the keywork "var"

    syntax:
        var <Variable-Name> <Datatype> = <Value>
        Declares a variable with name <Variable-Name> with <Datatype> and assigns <Value>
        <Datatype> or <Value> is optional, atleast one is mandatory
        
        Example:

        var integer int16 = 100 
        declares a varaible with name integer with datatype int16 and assigns 100.

        Example
        var integer int

        declares a variable with name integer of the datatype int and stores 0

        NOTE: by default every variable is assigned empty.
        integers(any integer signed or unsigned and of any size) will have default value 0
        float (float32 and float64) will have default value 0.0
        strings will have default value "" (Emptry strings)

        Aggregate datatypes will be intialized with empty values of the specific datatypes, we will discuss and understand this in detailed section on arrays and structures.

        Reference Datatype, by default it will be intialized with nil, acessing these varaibles without initialization will panic.

        Interface datatype, It would be very premature to discuss this here, we will take this up in Interface section
