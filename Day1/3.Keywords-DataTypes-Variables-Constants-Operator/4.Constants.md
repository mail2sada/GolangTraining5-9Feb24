# Constants
Name constant suggest it is fixed, in programming language as well, once a constant is defined it can't be modified any further. Consants can be of only basic datatypes integer constants, floating point constant, boolean constant, charecter constants and string literals. (It is not possible to declare constants as aggregate data types, reference datatypes and interface types)

## Delcaring constants.
Constants are declared using the keyword "const"

        syntax:
            const <Name> <Datatype> = <Value>
            // declaring a constant with <Name> of type <Datatype> and <Value> is stored in it
        Example 1:
            const c1 int = 100
            const c1, c2 int = 100, 10
            const c3, c4 = 10, "Hello"
            const Pi float64 = 3.14259
        
        Example 2: Constant block
            const (
                c1, c2 int = 100, 200
                c3 = "Hello"
                c4, c5 = true, 3.14159
            )
Example:

            package main

            import "fmt"

            func main() {
                fmt.Println("Demo: Constant declaration")

                const (
                    a, b int = 10, 20
                    c        = "Hello"
                    d, e     = true, 3.14159
                )
                fmt.Println(a, b, c, d, e)
            }
Example:

            package main

            import "fmt"

            const (
                a, b int    = 10, 20
                c           = 100
                d, e        = true, 3.14159
                f           = 'h'
                g    string = "Hello"
            )

            func main() {
                fmt.Println("Demo: Constant global block")
                fmt.Println(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)
            }
