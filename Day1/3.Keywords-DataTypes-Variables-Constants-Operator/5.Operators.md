# Operators.
Operators are the building blocks of any computer programs. As the name suggest operators will perform an operation on its operands to produce a reasult.

Operators in Golang are classified as below.

1. Airthmatic Operators 
Basic airthmatic opearations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulas.
We will see this in details further in this section
2. Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to compare to operands, less than, greater than, less than or equal, grater than or equal, equal to, and not equal are the operations. We will discuss this in detail later in this section
3. Logical operators
Logical operators main consists of and, or and not between expressions. We will discuss in details later in this section and in ControlFlows.\
4. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators work on the bitwise operations such as bitwise and, bitwise or, bitwise xor, left shift, right shift and "and not". We will wont be using this in out simple day to day application, bitwise operators are mainly used in device driver development, codec development etc
5. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assigns the values from operands to oparand. (=), (+=), (-=),(*=),(/=), (%=), (&=), (|=), (^=),(<<=) and (>>=).

## Airthmatic Operators

1. (+) Addition
2. (-) Subtraction
3. (*) Multiplication
4. (/) Division
5. (*)
    Code:
                package main

                import "fmt"

                func main() {
                    fmt.Println("Demo: Airthmatic Operators")

                    var a, b int = 100, 200

                    sum := a + b
                    diff := a - b
                    mul := a * b
                    div := a / b
                    mod := a % b

                    fmt.Println("Sum is:", sum, "Diff is:", diff, "Product is:", mul, "Quotient is:", div, "Remainder:", mod)
                }
## Relational Operators

1. == (equal to)
2. != (not equal to)
3. < (less than)
4. > (greater than)
5. <= (less than or equal to)
6. >= (greater than or equal to)

        Example: 
                package main

                import "fmt"

                func main() {
                    fmt.Println("Demo: Relational Operators")
                    x := 5
                    y := 8
                    isEqual := x == y          // false
                    isNotEqual := x != y       // true
                    isLess := x < y            // true
                    isGreater := x > y         // false
                    isLessOrEqual := x <= y    // true
                    isGreaterOrEqual := x >= y // false
                    fmt.Println(isEqual, isNotEqual, isLess, isGreater, isLessOrEqual, isGreaterOrEqual)
                }
## Logical Operators:
1. && (logical AND)
2. || (logical OR)
3. ! (logical NOT)

Example :
                package main

                import "fmt"

                func main() {
                    fmt.Println("Demo: Logical Operators")
                    p := true
                    q := false
                    andResult := p && q // false
                    orResult := p || q  // true
                    notResult := !p     // false
                    fmt.Println(andResult, orResult, notResult)
                }
## Bitwise Operators
1. & (bitwise AND)
2. | (bitwise OR)
3. ^ (bitwise XOR)
4. << (left shift)
5. >> (right shift)
6. &^ (bit clear, AND NOT)


Example 

                package main

                import "fmt"

                func main() {
                    fmt.Println("Demo: Bitwise Operators")
                    a := 5               // 101 in binary
                    b := 3               // 011 in binary
                    andResult := a & b   // 1 (001 in binary)
                    orResult := a | b    // 7 (111 in binary)
                    xorResult := a ^ b   // 6 (110 in binary)
                    leftShift := a << 1  // 10 (1010 in binary)
                    rightShift := a >> 1 // 2 (10 in binary)
                    bitClear := a &^ b   // 4 (100 in binary)
                    fmt.Println(andResult, orResult, xorResult, leftShift, rightShift, bitClear)
                }

## Assignment operators

1. = (assignment)
2. += (addition assignment)
3. -= (subtraction assignment)
4. *= (multiplication assignment)
5. /= (division assignment)
6. %= (modulo assignment)
7. &= (bitwise AND assignment)
8. |= (bitwise OR assignment)
9. ^= (bitwise XOR assignment)
10. <<= (left shift assignment)
11. >>= (right shift assignment)
12. &^= (bit clear assignment)

Example:

                package main

                import "fmt"

                func main() {
                    fmt.Println("Demo: Assignment Operators")
                    x := 10
                    x += 5 // equivalent to x = x + 5
                    fmt.Println(x)
                    x *= 2 // equivalent to x = x * 2
                    fmt.Println(x)
                }
