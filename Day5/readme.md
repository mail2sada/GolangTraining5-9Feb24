Endpoint Accessibility:

Implement a service or endpoint that can be pinged or queried specifically for the database's health. If multiple pods are unable to reach this endpoint, it could indicate database unavailability.
Consensus Algorithm:

Implement a consensus algorithm among your application pods. If a majority of pods agree that the database is unreachable, it may be a sign that the database is down.

Graceful Degradation:

Implement a strategy for graceful degradation. If a pod consistently fails to connect to the database, the application should degrade gracefully, perhaps by serving a limited set of features or providing a user-friendly error message.
